\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sec:conclude}

This paper has demonstrated our work in progress towards supporting SSP in order to provide graphical editing support for the composition (and adaptation) of FMUs directly inside the INTO-CPS Application. We envisage that this will increase the user-friendliness of the INTO-CPS Application since it requires one external tool less and it will be able to support more than what is possible in the SysML CPS profile.
%By the time of the Overture workshop we expect that the majority of these ideas will be incorporated into the cloud version of the INTO-CPS Application \cite{Rasmussen&19}. 
Furthermore, there are additional ideas (see below) for how additional improvements can be made for this technology.
